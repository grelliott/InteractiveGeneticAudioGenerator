// set up some ambient pads (squeeks, groans, whooshes)

// readme https://theseanco.github.io/howto_co34pt_liveCode/2-1-Recommended-Addons/

// add some clicking sounds (wooden, insecty, metallic)
// use samples for these

// add some voices (with echo and delay)
// maybe like those voices from Annihilation
// or choral-sounding (uplifting)

/*
 * Look at VST plugins for some fx
 * for sound FX:
 * need a very good reverb, with a few parameters
 * need a good timestretch and pitchbend
 *
 * for audio FX:
 * need a limiter
 * need an EQ
 * need a bandpass filter
 *

/*
 * Maybe layer up different samples? Skip the synths for now?
 * Maybe key samples and play as notes?
 */

// add some sample playback (through tape stretch, saturation, delay)

// TODO maybe I can create a single reverb and run sends from synths to it and back?
